# Instance Segmentation on Indoor Objects Datasets

## Description
The main objective of the project is to train/finetune, evaluate, test, and run inference on a model capable of performing instance-level segmentation on a pre-defined set of objects, a combination of different datasets could be used. The combined dataset should be trained on one or multiple state-of-the-art models. A comparison between the models is required regarding precision and execution speed (FPS). A theoretical comparison justifying the choice of the model is also acceptable.
